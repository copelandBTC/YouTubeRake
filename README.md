An automated controller for the Python module youtube-dl. Downloads, sorts, and formats videos given as little as a single URL

DISCLAIMER: This is a personal project and is not necessarily intended to run well on someone else's machine. I am posting this to github
in order to showcase some of my personal project experience. 

Youtube-dl is a widely-used Python command-line tool used to download media from various websites. This is a personal program 
I made that acts as a sort of controller for youtube-dl, automating the download process and performing some post-download
formatting and sorting tasks. 

The objective of this program is to automate the process described above as much as possible, invoking the program from a
terminal and giving it as little as a single URL to work with. However, it also offers optional user-defined parameters for
tagging of the files, such as artist, album, to download as an mp3 or an mp4, etc.

For future development, I intend to expand the project into a further-extended heirarchy of controllers, automatically invoking
the program at certain times of day, downloading media as specified from a user-defined file.
